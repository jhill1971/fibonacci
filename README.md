# fibonacci
A program to generate the first N numbers of the Fibonacci series.
Author: James Hill

## Explanation
### Data Division:
* N is the number of Fibonacci terms to generate. This is input by the user.
* I is the loop counter.
* FIBONACCI-NUMBER holds the current Fibonacci number. 
* PREVIOUS-NUMBER holds the previous Fibonacci number.
* TEMP-NUMBER Holds the Fibonacci number during calculation.
* COUNTER is a counter for the loop. It starts at 2 because the first two numbers are already initialized.

### Procedure Division
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of terms.
2. The program displays the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
3. A loop runs until the counter exceeds the user-specified number, calculating each new fibonacci number and displaying it.
